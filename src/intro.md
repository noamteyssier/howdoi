# [ ` How Do I ... ? ` ]

Hello!

This is a growing collection of tutorials focused around bioinformatics, analysis,
and programming in the life sciences.

Take a look at the sidebar for the topics.

If there are things you don't know how to do and want help feel free to reach out
and I can write more tutorials or clear up confusing information.

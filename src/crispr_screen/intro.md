# CRISPR Screening

So you just ran a CRISPR screen and got your sequencing files back - what next?

The analysis follows a few steps:

1. Mapping your sequencing reads to your reference library
2. Differential expression of guide RNA abundances
3. Aggregation of guide differential expression into differential expression of genes
4. Vizualization and interpretation

# Background Processing

This is a small note to mention that many of the analyis steps
upcoming may take a long time to run and you may not be at your
computer for their entire length.

Most often you will run this on a remote computer, so I wanted to
provide a few links and a quick intro to remote screens.
This is software that is optional, but very useful, so that you
are not kicked off remote servers when you close your computer
or if you have inactivity.

Some nice options for screens are:

1. [zellij](https://zellij.dev/)
2. [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)
3. [screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/manual/screen.html)

There are tutorials elsewhere for how to use these, but again just wanted
to mention them here so that you don't have to restart any analyses.

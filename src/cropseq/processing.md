# Sequence Processing

The first step of the analysis is taking the sequence data to numerical data.
This section of the tutorial is focused on those initial steps.

There will first be two sequencing alignment steps:

1. Aligning the 10X sequences to the transcriptome
2. Aligning the PCR sequences to the sgRNA sequences

Then there will be an assignment step to link the 10X reads to their
corresponding sgRNA.
